Bring Down the House will eventually be an L2 minigame. One player plays as the 'house' and puts in a bigger stake than the other players. The other players are trying to 'bring down the house', current iteration is they lock in a weapon choice along with other like players. Once the threshold is hit, the game starts and if the correct weapons needed to 'bring down the house' are chosen, the house loses and their stake is distributed to other participants. Then vice versa if the correct weapons were not chosen, the 'house' player gets the lesser funds of all the other participants.
